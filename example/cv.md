# About Me

---

In 2016 I entered the faculty of nuclear physics at the University of Havana, there I discovered programming,
fell in love, finished the first year with the best grades and applied for a change of major. Therefore, I
dedicate myself to the world of development and programming entirely by vocation. For me the most important
thing is to contribute to amazing projects and ideas and to be part of creative and human environments. In
recent years I have worked and studied (at university and self-taught) at the same time, so I have become an
organized person, with self-management skills and with a lot of capacity for sacrifice. I am very confident in
my abilities and my personality, so I don't have problem to start from the bottom and prove my worth. In my first
professional experience I started as an intern without knowledge of the language and frameworks and in less than
a year I became the leader of the development team of one of its main projects.
